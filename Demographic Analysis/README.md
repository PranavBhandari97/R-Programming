# Demographic Analysis

## Business Problem

### The dataset contains Demographic and Life Expectancy Data for various countries around the globe.
### The first part of the problem was to derive insights as to how the world population is distributed for various continents and according to various income groups and how it affects the plot of Inter Users vs Birth Rate
### The second part of the problem was to compare the Life Expectancy in 1960 and 2013 by creating a plot of Life Expectancy vs Fertility Rate.

## Insights:

###  Part 1
### I. Analysis according to Internet Users vs Birth Rate by Region
#### 1. In regions like Africa, the Birth Rate is extremely and the number of internet users very low.
#### 2. In regions like Europe, the number of internet users is almost 100% and the birth rate is low.
#### 3. The Americas is similar to Europe while having a higher birth rate as compared to Europe.
#### 4. Asia, Middle East, and Oceania is a 50-50 split with certain countries in all three regions having high number of internet users and low birth rates, while other countries having high birth rates(50% of Africa) and low number of internet users.
